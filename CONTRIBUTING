# Generating documentation

Ensure `sphinx` is installed.  

```console
$ pip install sphinx
$ conda install sphinx
```

Once you have added docstrings to some new functions, first reinstall PyGBe using either 

```console
$ python setup.py install
```

or

```console
$ python setup.py develop
```

In the root of `pygbe` run 

```console
$ sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source pygbe
```

Then enter the docs folder and run `make`

```console
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

Ensure that the docs have built correctly and that formatting, etc, is functional by opening the local docs in your browser

```console
firefox _build/html/index.html
```

If all looks right, then add and commit the changes to the `rst` files in `docs/source` and push.   Don't add or commit the `_build` directory as readthedocs will automatically generate documentation.

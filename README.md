# PyGBe: Python and GPU Boundary-integral solver for electrostatics

PyGBe—pronounced *pigbē*—is a Python library that applies the boundary integral 
method for biomolecular electrostatics and nanoparticle plasmonics.

PyGBe achieves both algorithmic and hardware acceleration. The solution
algorithm uses a [Barnes-Hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes–Hut_simulation)
treecode to accelerate each iteration of a GMRES solver to O(N logN),
for N unknowns. It exploits NVIDIA GPU hardware on the most
computationally intensive parts of the code using CUDA kernels in the
treecode, interfacing with PyCUDA. Some parts of the code are written in
C++, wrapped using Cython.

## Biomolecular electrostatics:

[![DOI_JOSS](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00043/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00043)

In this application, PyGBe uses continuum electrostatics to compute the solvation
energy for proteins modeled with any number of dielectric regions. The 
mathematical formulation follows Yoon and Lenhoff (1990) for solving the 
Poisson-Boltzmann equation of the [implicit-solvent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_solvation)
model in integral form.

## Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance:

[![DOI_JOSS](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00306/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00306)

PyGBe also uses electrostatics to compute the extinction cross section of 
scatterers that are much smaller than the incident wavelength. This is relevant, 
for example, to model localized surface plasmon resonance of nanoparticles, where
the quasi-static approximation is valid

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available at http://pygbe.github.io/pygbe/docs/

## Installation

### Regular installation

The following instructions assume that the operating system is Ubuntu. Run the
corresponding commands in your flavor of Linux to install.

### Dependencies (last tested)
* Python 3.4+ (3.6.1)
* Numpy 1.11.1+ (1.13.1)
* SciPy 0.17.1+ (0.19.1)
* Cython 0.24.1+ (0.24.1)
* NVCC 8.0 
    * gcc  5.4.0
* PyCUDA 2017.1.1
* matplotlib 1.5.1+ (2.0.2) (optional, for post-processing only)

#### Python and Numpy

To install the specific version of these packages we recommend using either
[conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/get-started.html) or
[pip](http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing/).

To create a new environment for using PyGBe with `conda` you can do the
following:

```console
conda create -n pygbe python=3.6 numpy scipy cython matplotlib
source activate pygbe
```

and then proceed with the rest of the installation instructions (although note
that if you do this, `cython` is already installed.

#### Cython

To install Cython we recommend using either `conda`, your distribution package
manager or [Cython's website](http://cython.org/).

#### NVCC

[Download and install](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) the CUDA
Toolkit.

#### PyCUDA

PyCUDA must be installed from source. Follow the
[instructions](http://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/Installation) on the PyCUDA website.
We summarize the commands to install PyCUDA on Ubuntu here:

    > cd $HOME
    > mkdir src
    > cd src
    > wget https://github.com/inducer/pycuda/archive/v2016.1.2.tar.gz
    > tar -xvzf pycuda-2016.1.2.tar.gz
    > cd pycuda-2016.1.2
    > python configure.py --cuda-root=/usr/local/cuda
    > make
    > sudo make install

If you are not installing PyCUDA systemwide, do not use `sudo` to install and
simply run

    > make install

as the final command.

Test the installation by running the following:

    > cd test
    > python test_driver.py


### Installing PyGBe

Create a clone of the repository on your machine:

    > cd $HOME/src
    > git clone https://github.com/barbagroup/pygbe.git
    > cd pygbe
    > python setup.py install clean

If you are installing PyGBe systemwide (if you installed PyCUDA systemwide),
then use `sudo` on the install command

    > sudo python setup.py install clean


PyGBe has been run and tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 13.10, 15.04 and 16.04.


### Installation using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

Requirements:

* Install [`nvidia-docker`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker), (instructions in their README)
    - Check [pre-requisites](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation#prerequisites)
* Follow instructions at the top of `Dockerfile`.


## Run PyGBe

PyGBe cases are divided up into individual folders. We have included a few
example problems in `examples`.

Test the PyGBe installation by running the Lysozyme (`lys`) example in the
folder `examples`. The structure of the folder is as follows:

```
lys
  ˫ lys.param
  ˫ lys.config
  ˫ built_parse.pqr
  ˫ geometry/Lys1.face
  ˫ geometry/Lys1.vert
  ˫ output/
```

To run this case, you can use

    > pygbe examples/lys

To test PyGBe-LSPR, run the single silver sphere (``lspr_silver``) example.

To run lspr cases, you can use

    > pygbe-lspr examples/lspr_silver

To run any PyGBe case, you can pass `pygbe` (or ``pygbe-lspr`` if it's a LSPR
application) a relative or an absolute path to
the problem folder.

Note that PyGBe will grab the first `param` and `config` files that it finds in
the problem folder (they don't have to share a name with the folder, but it's
helpful for organization). If you want to explicitly pass in a
different/specific `param` or `config` file, you can use the `-p` and `-c`
flags, respectively.

If you have a centralized `geometry` folder, or want to reuse existing files
without copying them, you can also pass the `-g` flag to `pygbe` to point to the
custom location. Note that this path should point to a folder which contains a
folder called `geometry`, not to the `geometry` folder itself.

For more information on PyGBe's command line interface, run

    > pygbe -h

or

    > pygbe-lspr -h

### Mesh

In the `examples` folder, we provide meshes and `.pqr` files for a few example
problems. To plug in your own protein data, download the corresponding `.pdb`
file from the Protein Data Bank, then get its `.pqr` file using any PDB to PQR
converter (there are online tools available for this). Our code interfaces with
meshes generated using
[MSMS (Michel Sanner's Molecular Surface code)](http://mgltools.scripps.edu/packages/MSMS).

The meshes for the LSPR examples and some Poisson Boltzmann that involve spheres
were generated with a script called `mesh_sphere.py` located in 
`pygbe/preprocessing_tools/`.

In [Generate meshes and pqr](http://barbagroup.github.io/pygbe/docs/mesh_pqr_setup.html) you can find detailed instructions to generate the pqr and meshes.

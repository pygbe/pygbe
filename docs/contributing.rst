Developer's Guide
-----------------

Welcome to PyGBe's developer's guide! This is a place to keep track of
information that does not belong in a regular userguide.

Contributing to PyGBe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All code must go through the pull request review procedure. If you want
to add something to PyGBe, first fork the repository. Make your changes
on your fork of the repository and then open a pull request with your
changes against the main PyGBe repository.

New features should follow the following rules: 1. PEP8 style guide
should be followed 2. New features should include unit tests 3. All
functions should have NumPy style doctrings. See
`here <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`__
for reference)

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regression tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once everything is installed, you can use ``py.test`` to run the
regression tests, located in ``pygbe/tests``

To run any of the regression tests individually, you can pass the test
name to ``pytest``

.. code:: python

    py.test test_lysozome.py

or to run all of the tests just run ``py.test`` within the PyGBe
directory

.. code:: python

    py.test

Convergence tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a more robust set of tests located in
``pygbe/tests/convergence_tests``. These include comparisons to
analytical solutions and checks to ensure convergence over a series of
finer meshes.

Note that these tests take a few hours to run. To run them, navigate to
the convergence test folder and run

.. code:: python

    python run_convergence_tests.py

Any individual set of convergence tests can be run by specifying a given
test file, e.g.

.. code:: python

    python lysozyme.py

or

.. code:: python

    python sphere_dirichlet.py

Generating documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyGBe uses ```doctr`` <https://github.com/gforsyth/doctr>`__ to
automatically generate documentation using Travis CI. If you have made a
number of changes to the docs, it is best to first manually check them
to make sure everything if working as expected. Otherwise, don't worry
about it. Any changes to the docs will be automatically compiled using
Sphinx and then pushed to ``gh-pages`` when a PR is merged into
``master``.

Manually generating documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure ``sphinx`` is installed.

.. code:: console

    $ pip install sphinx
    $ conda install sphinx

Once you have added docstrings to some new functions, first reinstall
PyGBe using either

.. code:: console

    $ python setup.py install

or

.. code:: console

    $ python setup.py develop

In the root of ``pygbe`` run

.. code:: console

    $ sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source pygbe

Then enter the docs folder and run ``make``

.. code:: console

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

Ensure that the docs have built correctly and that formatting, etc, is
functional by opening the local docs in your browser

.. code:: console

    firefox _build/html/index.html

If there are any errors in the build (or warnings), then fix them. If
there are no errors and the docs look good on your local build, then
you're done! Open a PR with your changes and when it is merged, the
changes to the documentation will be automatically built and pushed by
Travis to the ``gh-pages`` branch.

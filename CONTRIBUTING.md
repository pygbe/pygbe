# Developer's Guide

Welcome to PyGBe's developer's guide!  This is a place to keep track of information that does not belong in a regular userguide.

## Contributing to PyGBe

All code must go through the pull request review procedure.
If you want to add something to PyGBe, first fork the repository.  Make your changes on your fork of the repository and then open a pull request with your changes against the main PyGBe repository.

New features should follow the following rules:
1. PEP8 style guide should be followed
2. New features should include unit tests
3. All functions should have NumPy style doctrings.  See [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt) for reference)

## Running the tests

### Regression tests
Once everything is installed, you can use `py.test` to run the regression tests, located in `pygbe/tests`

To run any of the regression tests individually, you can pass the test name to `pytest`

```python
py.test test_lysozome.py
```

or to run all of the tests just run `py.test` within the PyGBe directory

```python
py.test
```

### Convergence tests
There is a more robust set of tests located in `pygbe/tests/convergence_tests`.
These include comparisons to analytical solutions and checks to ensure convergence
over a series of finer meshes.

Note that these tests take a few hours to run.  To run them, navigate to the convergence test folder and run

```python
python run_convergence_tests.py
```

Any individual set of convergence tests can be run by specifying a given test file, e.g.

```python
python lysozyme.py
```

or

```python
python sphere_dirichlet.py
```

## Generating documentation

PyGBe uses [`doctr`](https://github.com/gforsyth/doctr) to automatically generate documentation using Travis CI.
If you have made a number of changes to the docs, it is best to first manually check them to make sure everything if working as expected.
Otherwise, don't worry about it.  Any changes to the docs will be automatically compiled using Sphinx and then pushed to `gh-pages` when a PR is merged into `master`.

### Manually generating documentation

Ensure `sphinx` is installed.

```console
$ pip install sphinx
$ conda install sphinx
```

Once you have added docstrings to some new functions, first reinstall PyGBe using either

```console
$ python setup.py install
```

or

```console
$ python setup.py develop
```

In the root of `pygbe` run

```console
$ sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source pygbe
```

Then enter the docs folder and run `make`

```console
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

Ensure that the docs have built correctly and that formatting, etc, is functional by opening the local docs in your browser

```console
firefox _build/html/index.html
```

If there are any errors in the build (or warnings), then fix them.
If there are no errors and the docs look good on your local build, then you're done!
Open a PR with your changes and when it is merged, the changes to the documentation will be automatically built and pushed
by Travis to the `gh-pages` branch.
